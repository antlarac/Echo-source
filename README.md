# Echo-source
Simple program to use as a last resort if during pentesting, we have a shell but are unable to upload files. This program takes a source code file and creates a long one liner containg echo commands, so that copying and pasting the output from this program to a remote shell (for the moment, linux shell) will create a replica of the file we cannot upload otherwise.

To use this progam, just do the following:
python echo_source.py input_file output_file

Here, the input_file is a text file you want to upload to a target host. output_file is an optional file_name that the file will have when you have uploaded it to the target, by pasting in the reverse shell the long one-liner generated by the Echo-source program. If nothing is specified, the default output will be out.txt
